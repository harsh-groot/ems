# ems (Employee Management System)

To run the project, Open the project in Visual studio 2022. Run the project in the browser.

The project is created with a good architecture. It has separate layers for Service, Repository, Datamodels, ViewModels and for Api(s). 
The project UI will be run on the port https://localhost:44491/ and the Swagger can be access from the Url https://localhost:44360/swagger/index.html.
